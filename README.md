As with the other repos (<a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol1">Soft Dorothy - Unfinished Tales Vol 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy-Shareware Projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Soft Dorothy - Casady & Greene Projects</a>), this is a disk image that can be mounted with a 68K Mac emulator. This disk image contains more projects that I began, did not complete.

Here is the continuation of the list that I presented part of in the README to Unfinished Tales Vol. 1. It ends where I was working on, had not shipped, **Mac Tuberling**. Other titles listed below that did ship were **Stella Obscura** and **Pararena**.

```

Though my book-keeping ended there, I have still more projects as you will see below (in what I believe is the order that they were worked on).

### Sled Run:

I like the artwork.

I remember a few skiing games from early game consoles like the *Intellivision*. I was also channeling fun times had as a child racing down a snow covered hill on a sled. (The ramps that get you airborne though are pure fantasy.)

<p align="center">

</p>

**Sled Run** is a good example of a game sketch where you say at this point, "Okay, but this isn't really fun." Here too though might be an example of a game where spending more time with it, trying various things, might in fact have brought it to a fun place. If networking were more of a thing back in May, 1990 (when it appears I wrote it) a sled racing game could have kicked ass.

> Only now I just remembered imagining as a kid specialized enclosed sleds designed for hours-long races down ... I don't know ... the Matterhorn? 

Turning the cursor into a bird was a cute addition, but I moved on.

### Tripod 3D:

I was fascinated by the stereo (actual 3D) images you could create on the Macintosh and did a rather ligthweight game called **Stella Obscura** about May of 1990. **Tripod 3D** was a kind of continuation of that. **Stella Obscura** was what you would call *parallel* stereo where, if you can relax your eyes, your eyes are looking in parallel at the two images: your left eye looking at the left image, your right eye looking at the right. Without additional optics, it's rather difficult for most people to do.

<p align="center">
<img width="512" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol2/blob/4c648fe242019ee73eac530abf11b176b9a75517/Images/Tripod3D.png">
</p>

**Tripod 3D** was just an experiment to test a different approach. One of the images, lets say the right one, is flipped as though a mirror image of what the right eye would see. The left image is normal. But you place a mirror, running vertical between the bridge of your nose and the center of the screen — separating the two images. If the reflective side of the mirror is to the right, your left eye sees the left image as per normal, but the right eye, will see the reflected right image in the mirror — hopefully precisely over the left image (if that makes sense).

<p align="center">

</p>

It's stereo just like **Stella Obscura** but much more relaxing for people to adjust their eyes to. The caveat of course is that you need to build a rather odd viewing contraption with the mirror and all that. For what it's worth, it the depth effect worked very well.

If you should give it a try, the mouse button activates the player's jetpack thruster in order for the player to gain elevation. Moving the mouse left and right moves the jet-pack'd player left and right, white moving the mouse verticaly actually moves the player in and out of depth. In this way you can circumnavigate the "tripod" in stereo.

### Thief of Baghdad (AKA, Carpet):

**Carpet** was the working title. **Thief of Baghdad** was a sketch for a "platformer" game — the platforms being magical flying carpets. Sad to say though, I never implemented hit detection code to enable our little thief to jump from one carpet to the next.

<p align="center">
<img width="512" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol2/blob/1b6cdf5890f867892f17f7392ff53e95d25c800f/Images/Carpet.png">
</p>

Sometimes, like this, you want to test a game mechanic/dynamic. In this case you can move the carpet up as fast as you like — getting our thief airborne. But he falls more slowly. The left and right mouse will move him — but only when his feet are on the carpet. Without going much further in the coding, I could see that it would be challenging (maybe a bit like **Frogger**?) but could be fun.

Although I put this aside in May, 1990, I would revisit the idea in early 1992. The new version would be in color (and renamed **Scheherazade**).

### AirBikes:

Around September, 1990 I was playing with **AirBikes**. The game **K-10** (see Unfinished Tales Vol. 1) was my first stab at a racing game, **AirBikes**, a side-scroller, was I guess my second. I didn't even get as far as I did in **K-10**. Your player is there, and you can steer, accelerate, brake. There are barrels blocking your path along the road but there isn't even basic collision detection so you can blaze right through them. There are no sounds, no enemies.

<p align="center">
<img width="512" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol2/blob/011d183ee9c24d1ec19933b05a27d8f323de93a8/Images/AirBikes.png">
</p>

It's too bad though because when I play with the game now, such as it is, I can hear some really cool sounds in my head that would really take the experience to the next level.

And the artwork (probably inspired by the first *Heavy Metal* film) is kind of cool. If you play with this at all watch how the exhaust pops from the airbike when you accelerate — the woman's hair is tosssed in the wind, she leans when she turns, pops up off the seat when braking.

</p>

My note for **AirBikes** from the text file at the top of this README says simply `<slow>`. Did I bail on the game simply for that reason — that it felt slow on my lowly Macintosh Plus? The sprite art shows the beginning of an opponent, floating mines, a riderless airbike. One can imagine dodging barrles, mines, opponents — occassionally be sent over the bars fo the airbike... Maybe I didn't really have anywhere else to go with it though.

Later I would partner with a programmer named Jeff Robbin to work on a colaborative racing-style game called **Spaceway 2000**. I think we both agree it was kind of "meh". Perhaps racing games were just not something I was meant to write. 

### Roll-A-Rena:
