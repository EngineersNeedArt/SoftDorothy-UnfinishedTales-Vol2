As with the other repos (<a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol1">Soft Dorothy - Unfinished Tales Vol 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy-Shareware Projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Soft Dorothy - Casady & Greene Projects</a>), this is a disk image that can be mounted with a 68K Mac emulator. This disk image contains more projects that I began, did not complete.

### Sled Run:

I like the artwork.

I remember a few skiing games from early game consoles like the *Intellivision*. I was also channeling fun times had as a child racing down a snow covered hill on a sled. (The ramps that get you airborne though are pure fantasy.)

**Sled Run** is a good example of a game sketch where you say at this point, "Okay, but this isn't really fun." Here too though might be an example of a game where spending more time with it, trying various things, might in fact have brought it to a fun place. If networking were more of a thing back in May, 1990 (when it appears I wrote it) a sled racing game could have kicked ass.

> Only now I just remembered imagining as a kid specialized enclosed sleds designed for hours-long races down ... I don't know ... the Matterhorn? 

Turning the cursor into a bird was a cute addition, but I moved on.

### Tripod 3D:

I was fascinated by the stereo (actual 3D) images you could create on the Macintosh and did a rather ligthweight game called **Stella Obscura** about May of 1990. **Tripod 3D** was a kind of continuation of that. **Stella Obscura** was what you would call *parallel* stereo where, if you can relax your eyes, your eyes are looking in parallel at the two images: your left eye looking at the left image, your right eye looking at the right. Without additional optics, it's rather difficult for most people to do.

</p>

**Tripod 3D** was just an experiment to test a different approach. One of the images, lets say the right one, is flipped as though a mirror image of what the right eye would see. The left image is normal. But you place a mirror, running vertical between the bridge of your nose and the center of the screen — separating the two images. If the reflective side of the mirror is to the right, your left eye sees the left image as per normal, but the right eye, will see the reflected right image in the mirror — hopefully precisely over the left image (if that makes sense).

</p>

It's stereo just like **Stella Obscura** but much more relaxing for people to adjust their eyes to. The caveat of course is that you need to build a rather odd viewing contraption with the mirror and all that. For what it's worth, it the depth effect worked very well.

If you should give it a try, the mouse button activates the player's jetpack thruster in order for the player to gain elevation. Moving the mouse left and right moves the jet-pack'd player left and right, white moving the mouse verticaly actually moves the player in and out of depth. In this way you can circumnavigate the "tripod" in stereo.

### Thief of Baghdad (AKA, Carpet):

**Carpet** was the working title. **Thief of Baghdad** was a sketch for a "platformer" game — the platforms being magical flying carpets. Sad to say though, I never implemented hit detection code to enable our little thief to jump from one carpet to the next.

<p align="center">

</p>

Sometimes, like this, you want to test a game mechanic/dynamic. In this case you can move the carpet up as fast as you like — getting our thief airborne. But he falls more slowly. The left and right mouse will move him — but only when his feet are on the carpet. Without going much further in the coding, I could see that it would be challenging (maybe a bit like **Frogger**?) but could be fun.

Although I put this aside in May, 1990, I would revisit the idea in early 1992. The new version would be in color (and renamed **Scheherazade**).

### AirBikes:

Around September, 1990 I was playing with **AirBikes**.
