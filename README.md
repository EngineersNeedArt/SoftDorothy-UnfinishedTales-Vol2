# Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol 2)

The second part of a collection of Soft Dorothy Software scraps and game experiments from the early 90's.

### Sled Run:

I like the artwork.

I remember a few skiing games from early game consoles like the *Intellivision*. I was also channeling fun times had as a child racing down a snow covered hill on a sled. (The ramps that get you airborne though are pure fantasy.)

A good example of a game sketch where you say at this point, "Okay, but this isn't really fun." Here too though might be an example of a game where spending more time with it, trying various things, might in fact have brought it to a fun place. If networking were more of a thing back in May, 1990 (when it appears I wrote it) a sled racing game could have kicked ass.

> Only now I just remembered imagining as a kid specialized enclosed sleds designed for hours-long races down ... I don't know ... the Matterhorn? 

Turning the cursor into a bird was a cute addition, but I moved on.

### Tripod 3D:
